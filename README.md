In this exercise I have create a small JDBC application that uses the “world” database provided by 
MySQL. 
I have created a class (CityDaoJDBC)
that implements an interface (CityDao).
I have used PreparedStatements where 
the methods have arguments. I also needed a City class that hold the data which I have received 
from the ResultSet.
